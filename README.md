# Mercatus code challenge

Hi there!

Please write _thorough_ and _human-readable_ tests for the `WaitlistController.php`.

 - You can use unit, feature and/or browser tests
 - Cover corner-cases / regressions
 - The tests don't actually need run

Please email your submission __in form of a link__ to either _a fork of this gist with your test files added_, or alternatively _a public git repository_.

Estimated time: `1 hour`  
Deadline: `2019-09-12T09:00:00-07:00`
